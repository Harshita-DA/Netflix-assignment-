- Type: Whether the content is a TV Show or a Movie
- Director: Name of the director(s) (if available)
- Cast: List of main actors in the content
- Country: Country of origin
- Date_Added: Date when the content was added to Netflix
- Release_Year: The year the content was released
- Rating: Content rating (e.g., PG, R, TV-MA)
- Duration: Duration of the movie or number of seasons for TV shows
- Genre (Listed in Dataset as 'Listed_in')**: Categories or genres of the content
- Description: A brief summary of the content

# Objectives
- Understand the distribution of content types (Movies vs. TV Shows)
- Analyze content trends based on release years and addition dates
- Identify the most common genres available on Netflix
- Examine the distribution of ratings and their significance
